### Introduction
This project analyzes the game Snakes and Ladders, which originates all the way back to ancient India in the 2nd century CE. 
Now, my motivation for this project was inspired by a heated game of Monopoly between my friends and me that lasted nearly five hours. During this five-hour span, I noticed a couple things.
One being the fact that the game never ended no matter how many times we rolled the dice. And the second, more interestingly, was the fact that I felt that we were always landing on the same few
squares and narrowly dodging others. This made me wonder if there is a statistical reasoning for this.
